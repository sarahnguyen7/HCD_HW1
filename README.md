Pageview data was pulled from desktop, mobile-web, and mobile-app using the Wikipedia API.

## Source Data
The rare diseases data is a subset of Wikipedia article pages. This is a subset of the English Wikipedia that represents a large number of articles related to rare diseases. This list of pages was collected by using a database of rare diseases maintained by the National Organization for Rare Diseases (NORD) and matching them to Wikipedia articles that are either about a rare disease or have a section that mentions a rare disease.

## Data Schema
The schema was designed to ... go back to this later, need to look up database class info
Each JSON file contains the following structure:

```json
{
    "article_title": {
        "platform_name": [
            {
                "project": "string",
                "granularity": "string",
                "timestamp": "YYYYMMDDHH",
                "agent": "string",
                "views": "integer"
            }
        ]
    }
}
